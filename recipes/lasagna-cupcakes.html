    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>⅓ pound ground beef</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>24 wonton wrappers</li>
        <li>

1 ¾ cups grated Parmesan cheese
</li>
<li>

1 ¾ cups shredded mozzarella cheese
</li>
<li>

¾ cup ricotta cheese
</li>
<li>1 cup pasta sauce</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Prepare muffin cups with cooking spray. </li>
<li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Drain and discard grease from beef. </li>
<li>Cut wonton wrappers into 2 1/4-inch circles with a biscuit cutter. Press one wonton into the bottom of each muffin cup. Sprinkle even amounts of Parmesan cheese, mozzarella cheese, and ricotta cheese into each muffin cup; top each portion with even amounts of ground beef and pasta sauce. </li>
<li>Divide 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, 1/2 of the ricotta cheese, 1/2 of the ground beef mixture, and 1/2 cup pasta sauce, between the muffin cups and layer, respectively, atop wonton wrapper; repeat layering with remaining wonton wrappers, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, remaining ricotta cheese, remaining ground beef, and remaining pasta sauce. Top "cupcakes" with remaining Parmesan cheese and mozzarella cheese.</li>
<li>Bake in preheated oven until edges of "cupcakes" are browned, 18 to 20 minutes; let rest in tins for 5 minutes before running a knife around the edges to loosen and remove. Garnish with fresh basil to serve. </li>
    </ol>
